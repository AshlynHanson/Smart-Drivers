## Description

This is a project created for the Mizzou 2022 Tigerhacks hackathon. It is a Wix website to provide a sober driving service to all students at a given university. It provides forms for students to fill out to either drive or be a passenger and Twilio to send text messages to both a sober driver and a student who requests a ride.
College students do not always have reliable access to a sober driver when they want to go out and drink, so this project will provide a resource for them to get a safe and sober driver.
Users can go to smartdrivers.tech to view the webpage and fill out the forms.
