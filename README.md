## About the Site

## Description

This is a project created for the Mizzou 2022 Tigerhacks hackathon. It is a Wix website to provide a sober driving service to all students at a given university. It provides forms for students to fill out to either drive or be a passenger and Twilio to send text messages to both a sober driver and a student who requests a ride.
College students do not always have reliable access to a sober driver when they want to go out and drink, so this project will provide a resource for them to get a safe and sober driver.
Users can go to smartdrivers.tech to view the webpage and fill out the forms.

## Business Plan

We have heard countless stories from people all over college campuses discussing the issue of having designated drivers. It’s a classic scenario: a group of friends wants to go to the bar, and then everybody starts staring at each other because nobody wants to be the sober one. Someone complains about always having to be the designated driver, and then someone else points fingers at the person who never volunteers to drive. If everyone refuses to be the designated driver, the only option is to find a ride from another friend or a stranger. Many sororities and fraternities have systems where one person must organize and execute rides for their members, but for the people who are not involved in these organizations, most people turn to Uber because it’s the most convenient. People who are not in a sorority or fraternity may not have the luxury of having a sober driver when they go out. In the worst-case scenario, they drive under the influence or they get into the backseat of a car with an intoxicated driver. According to Toney Law Firm LLC, 30% of college students admit to driving under the influence of alcohol and over 50% of college students report getting into a car with an intoxicated driver (The Toney Law Firm, 2021). We believe that all students attending a college or university should have a resource to be able to get home safely and this is why we created Smart Drivers. It can allow every student to get a safe ride home without breaking the bank or bothering their roommate for the 100th time. SmartDrivers is a free website that universities and colleges can utilize for their students that can track, record, and organize sober drivers for students that need them.
